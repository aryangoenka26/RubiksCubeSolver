## RubiksCubeSolver
This program represents a (3X3) Rubiks Cube using 3 different models and incorporates various Algorithms to solve any valid cube.

## Features
- Represent Cube in 3 different models, bitboard being the fastest!
- Shuffle the cube as many times as you want using a shuffle cube function, takes input the number of times you want to shuffle.
- Choose an Algorithm from BFS, DFS, IDDFS, IDA* to solve.
- In output recieve the steps to solve the cube, which you can try on a physical cube too!

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/aryangoenka26/RubiksCubeSolver
```

Start the server

- Go to main.cpp.
- Play around with different functions to understand how code is working.
- Some code for each solver is already there which was used for testing.

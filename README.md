# RubiksCubeSolver
This repository contains a C++ program that models a virtual Rubik's Cube (3x3) and provides solutions using various algorithms.
# Prerequisites
1) C++ compiler compatible with C++11 or above.
2) Preferably use CLION environment for better experience.

# How to run the project 
Clone The Project 

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```
Run the the main.cpp file
# Features
1. Modeled a virtual Rubik's Cube using standard data structures like unordered_map in C++
2. Implemented three different models/classes using object-oriented programming concepts (inheritance, function overloading, etc.) for 
   code reusability
3. Achieved solving time of under 3 seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 8 times using BFS, DFS, and IDDFS algorithms
4. Developed a corner pattern database to store move counts required to solve the cube
5. Optimized the corner pattern database using a Nibble Array, reducing memory usage by 50%
6. Implemented Korf's IDA* Algorithm, achieving solving time of under 10 seconds for a Rubik's Cube jumbled 13 times
